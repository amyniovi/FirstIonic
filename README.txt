For this app you ll need :

install Node.js (package manager -npm) :
go to: nodejs.org

After getting Node install Ionic:
npm install ionic -g

Install Cordova:
npm install cordova -g


I personally had to include in the project(lib folder):
cordova.js
cordova_plugins.js

and install cordova plugins :

1.Keyboard and
2.statusBar

as well as include them in the project

those are :
cordova-plugin-statusbar-master
Keyboard-2.0.1


To run app from cmnd prompt:

you go inside the folder (FirstIonic folder)

C:/FirstIonic/>ionic serve

(that doesnt work for me all the time, i run straight from webstorm) but it looks like crap cant get it to look like a
mobile app without the ionic stuff)
